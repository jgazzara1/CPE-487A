for Digital System Design at Stevens Institute of Technology

Due to COVID-19, I have lost access to experiment with the board physically. I will attempt to complete these labs without accesss to the board. Some files may not run properly as I cannot refine them to fuction on a Nexys A7-100T in class. 

This code is my best shot at what I would do to complete the lab.
